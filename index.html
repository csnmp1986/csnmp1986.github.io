<p>Hi, I’m Dr Christopher Sirrs, a historian based at the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk">University of Warwick, UK </a>. My research interests as an historian are diverse, encompassing the history of medicine, public health, risk, and safety. 
  <p>My current research, funded by the <a href="https://www.wellcome.ac.uk">Wellcome Trust</a>, explores the history of 'safety' in the British National Health Service. As Covid-19 has dramatically brought to the fore, the safety of patients and the health and safety of hospital staff are interlinked.
    <a href="https://hazardoushospitals.com">'Hazardous Hospitals: Cultures of Safety in NHS General Hospitals, c.1960-Present'</a> explores the development of ideas, norms, values and practices around safety in NHS hospitals. 
    These include policies around patient and staff consultation, to reporting and learning systems, clinical audit, whistleblowing procedures, risk assessment, and campaigns around various hazards.

<p>Previously, I have investigated the emergence of anxieties around 'fake' drugs in global health, and the intellectual and policy history of 'health systems' thinking. My research has involved examining the role of international agencies such as the World Health Organisation, International Labour Organisation and World Bank, as well as national regulatory agencies such as the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE). 
  My PhD, completed in 2016, explored the historical development of the British system of health and safety regulation: a theme I am now continuing to explore, in the domain of hospitals.
